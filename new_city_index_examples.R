# Calculate city index using new method

# New concepts:
# - Using only MDT (normal situation, seasonally adjusted)
# - Traffic work weights (need traffic links)
# - Chaining when necessary (need to suitably subdivide index period, possibly one road net version per subperiod)
# - Estimate confidence interval (compare and decide which method to use)
# - Measures of representativity

# To be included later:
# - Seasonally adjusted MDT
# - Vehicle classification by type, not just length

# Resolution in time:
# - Month by month
# - So far this year
# - Last 12 months
# - Last 24 months
# - Last 36 months

# Resolution in day type
# - working days
# - non-working days
# - all days

# Resolution in vehicle type:
# - light (short)
# - heavy (long)
# - all

# How to compare:
# - new versus old index results in different time resolutions, separated from new chaining strategies
# - the impact of new chaining strategies leading to better representativity


# What are isolated improvements?
# - measures of representativity, especially traffic work
# - smaller (?) confidence interval, mostly (?) due to finiteness of population
# - traffic work weights

# Suitable cities as examples:
# - Bergen (chaining might be useful)
# - Buskerudbyen (has had representativity issues, no chaining?)
# - Trondheim (representativity issues, no chaining?)
# - Nord-JÃ¦ren (with new chaining strategy)
